INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS FOR XORGIDLEMANAGER
--------------------------------------------

1. Prerequisites:

Before compiling the program, ensure you have the required dependencies installed on your system. Specifically, you will need the gcc compiler, the pkg-config utility, and the gtk+-3.0 library.

On a Debian-based system, you can install the dependencies using the following command:

bash
sudo apt-get install build-essential pkg-config libgtk-3-dev

2. Download the Program:

Download the source code of XorgIdleManager from the official repository or the provided location. Extract it if it is in a compressed format.

3. Compile the Program:

To compile the source code, open a terminal in the directory containing the XorgIdleManager.c file and run the following command:

bash
gcc `pkg-config --cflags gtk+-3.0` -o XorgIdleManager XorgIdleManager.c `pkg-config --libs gtk+-3.0`

This will generate an executable binary file named XorgIdleManager.

4. Run the Program:

After compiling and installing the program, you can run it by specifying the correct path to the binary file. For example, if the binary is placed in a directory like /usr/local/bin, you can run the program by simply typing:

bash
XorgIdleManager

However, if you place the binary elsewhere, make sure to specify the full or relative path to the executable. For instance:

bash
/path/to/XorgIdleManager

If you want to run the program from anywhere without specifying the path each time, you can add its directory to your system's $PATH variable.

5. Uninstall the Program:

To uninstall the program, remove the binary file from its installation directory. For example, if the program was installed in /usr/local/bin, you can run:

bash
sudo rm /usr/local/bin/XorgIdleManager

Additionally, the program may create a daemon script named XorgIdleManager_daemon.sh in the same directory as the executable. If present, this script should also be removed:

bash
sudo rm /usr/local/bin/XorgIdleManager_daemon.sh

If you installed it in another directory, adjust the paths accordingly for both the program and the daemon script.

6. Troubleshooting:

If you encounter issues during installation or execution, ensure that all required dependencies are installed and that file paths are correctly specified. You can also check system logs for any error messages that may provide further insight.
